Fourier Transform Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool that helps you understand how signals behave in the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
This visualizer can generate synthetic signals, analyze uploaded audio files and even display real-time microphone spectrum — making it a powerful learning tool for students and engineers.

⭐ ✨ Features

🎵 Generate Synthetic Signals
Sine wave, dual-tone, chirp, square wave, and more.

🎧 Upload and Analyze Audio Files
View the time-domain waveform and frequency spectrum.

🎤 Live Microphone FFT
Real-time dynamic frequency visualization using your mic.

📊 Graphical Outputs

Time-domain waveform

Frequency magnitude spectrum

Live microphone spectrum

⚡ FFT-Based Frequency Analysis
Fast and accurate using JavaScript FFT implementation.

🛠 User-friendly Controls
Adjust frequency, sample rate, FFT size and signal type.

⭐ 📘 About the Project

The goal of this project is to make Fourier Transform concepts easier to understand by visualizing signals in both time and frequency domains. Students often find raw waveforms confusing — this tool converts them into clear frequency components.

This visualizer is ideal for:

Engineering students

DSP learners

Audio enthusiasts

Project demonstrations

Research experiments

⭐ 🚀 How It Works
